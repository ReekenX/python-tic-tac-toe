Tic Tac Toe - yep, another implementation of this game

This is my *Tic Tac Toe* game written in Python. There is nothing special for so far, just command line game.

I have created this game to show others who wants to make something simple and learn Python. Hope this will help.

To start the game enter in command line::

    $ python shell.py
